            It makes me giddy with excitement to write this note because honestly, why wouldn't it? After all, it was because of the
            Venatus family that I finally got a new lease of life. It's hard to articulate all my emotions in a single note, but
            I'll give it a shot. To me, Venatus is so much more than just a gaming society. There are no fetters or shackles to hold
            you back. It's a place where I have been able to give a free run to my imagination- from Marvel and Pok√©mon themed
            events to our own version of team building activities- it has been a rollercoaster. It's like if you have a stress
            called 'college', then Venatus is the medication for you. This place blessed me with a crazy bunch of friends, spending
            time with whom has always given me immense pleasure. Venatus turned me from a suicidal idiot into a vivacious girl who
            has never been more in love with life and for that, I'll always be wholeheartedly grateful.
