    <p class="lead">
        Venatus is known to provide high-end gear for event management and create major events attracting crowd form outside
        Delhi as well. Our gamers have been very notable in the gaming competitions held throughout Delhi, retaining their lead
        in every major tournament. WE have previously collaborated with the Education Tree, DewArena, Paradise Ganers, Burger
        King, Battle Groups Cafe, Nexus gaming cafe, Nodwin gaming, Immortal Gaming Cafe, among many others. WE keep two annual
        events
        year on our college campus, namely: AIMBOT for Esports and SEEK: for outdoors. As a nonprofit organization, we have
        managed to raise over 5.6lakh rupees in a period of 3 years and 90% was reinvested to provide quality service and gaming
        platform.
        
        The society organizes a recruitment drive every year in the month of August, focusing on building a reliable, efficient,
        hard-working and motivated team to lead the society.
        
        The outdoor section has received sponsorship from big names like Zomato, Croma, Aakash institute, among others. Who
        provide prizes and logistics to carry out these events.
        
        Lastly, Venatus also takes part in CSR. As a duty to our society - every year we organize one event for either social
        awareness or for helping economically backward children.
        
        In 2019, we organized MATDAAN as an election awareness campaign among our youth and it aimed at creating awareness
        about the importance of voting and understanding the complete polling process.
        
        So aforementioned was a snapshot of life as a member of Venatus - The Gaming Society of NSUT, where we create a
        family-like atmosphere for all members -new and old alike, a place where everyone gets a chance to hone their skills in
        the four years of our college, a place where fun and learning never halts.
